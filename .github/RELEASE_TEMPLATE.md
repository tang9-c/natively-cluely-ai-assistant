  2. Open Terminal and run: `xattr -cr /Applications/CueUp.app`

- **For .dmg downloads:**
  1. Open Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     xattr -cr ~/Downloads/CueUp-<version>-arm64.dmg
     # Or for Intel Macs:
     xattr -cr ~/Downloads/CueUp-<version>-x64.dmg
     ```

## ⚠️Windows Installation (Unsigned Build)

When running the installer on Windows, you might see a "Windows protected your PC" warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen saying it prevented an unrecognized app from starting. 

Since this is an unsigned build, this is expected. You can safely ignore it by clicking **More info** and then **Run anyway**.
