/**
 * IPv4-only DNS resolver for STT WebSocket connections.
 *
 * Why this exists: on macOS, Node's default `getaddrinfo(AF_UNSPEC)` lookup on
 * dual-stack hosts can return a hard `ENOTFOUND` for IPv4-only CNAME chains
 * (e.g. api.natively.software → *.up.railway.app → 66.33.22.108) when the
 * machine has a link-local IPv6 address (fe80::…) but no real v6 path.
 * curl/libcurl handles this gracefully by falling back to v4; libuv on Darwin
 * sometimes does not. Symptom: `nslookup` and `curl` resolve fine from the
 * same machine, but every `new WebSocket('wss://…')` fires
 * `error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND <host>` — never reaching the server, so
 * transcripts never start.
 *
 * Forcing family=4 mirrors curl's effective behavior: skip IPv6 entirely.
 * Streaming STT endpoints (Natively, ElevenLabs, Soniox, OpenAI Realtime) are
 * effectively IPv4-only at the edge today, so we lose nothing by pinning the
 * resolver here. If a vendor later moves to IPv6-only or v6-preferred, swap
 * to family=0 (AF_UNSPEC) with a custom v6→v4 fallback.
