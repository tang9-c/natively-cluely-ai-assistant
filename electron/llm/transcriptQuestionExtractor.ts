// electron/llm/transcriptQuestionExtractor.ts
//
// Deterministic (NO LLM) extractor that pulls the latest meaningful
// interviewer question out of the last ~180s of meeting transcript and
// classifies its perspective/shape. Runs on the "What to answer?" hot path,
// so it must be fast (<500ms p95 — in practice sub-millisecond, it's pure
// string work) and never block on a model.
//
// Why this exists: the live answer pipeline previously fed the whole sparsified
// transcript to the LLM and relied on it to infer "what is being asked". That
// (a) wastes prompt tokens, (b) lets transcription noise/greetings dominate, and
// (c) loses the speaker perspective — so an interviewer's "tell me about your
// projects" could be answered as if the *assistant* were asked about *its* work.
// Extracting the question deterministically lets us route context correctly
// (run profile grounding on the real question) and answer in the candidate's
// first-person voice.
//
// Fully dynamic: no profile-, company-, or fixture-specific strings. Everything
// is derived from the transcript turns and generic question/role grammar.
